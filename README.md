# Bicolor_Towers_Of_Hanoi
Solution implemented in C, Prolog and Scheme
Bicolor Tower of Hanoi solution implemented in C, Prolog and Scheme.
The bicolor towers of Hanoi problem is a variation of traditional towers of Hanoi problem. (It was offered to grade 3-6 students at2`eme Championnat de Francedes Jeux Math ́ematiques et Logiquesheld in July 1988). Suppose there arethree pegs, A, B and C. Suppose there are two sets of disks α and β, where α={αi | 1 <= i <= n } and β = {βi | 1 <= i <= n} such that color of everydisk in α is blue and color of every disk in β is red.

The initial configuration is:

The final configuration is:

The rules of the problem are the same of Hanoi:

	1) Only one disk can be moved at any time.

	2) At no time can a larger disk be placed on a smaller disk. Same size diskscan be placed over one another.
